# 🎉 Setup Complete!

Your Kahoot Agent is now ready to use! Here's what you can do:

## ✅ Installation Status
- ✅ Python 3.13 with virtual environment
- ✅ All dependencies installed (OpenCV, EasyOCR, Tesseract, etc.)
- ✅ Tesseract OCR installed via Homebrew
- ✅ All components tested and working

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Make sure your virtual environment is active:
```bash
source kahoot-env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Test the installation:
```bash
python test_components.py
```

### 3. Try the agent (SAFE MODE):
```bash
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single
```

## 📱 Usage Examples

### Safe Testing
```bash
# Process one question safely (no clicking)
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single

# Monitor continuously (shows answers, doesn't click)
python kahoot_agent.py --mode continuous
```

### Interactive Examples
```bash
# Run interactive examples
python example_usage.py
```

### Advanced Usage (USE WITH CAUTION!)
```bash
# Auto-click with high confidence requirement
python kahoot_agent.py --mode continuous --auto-click --confidence 0.7

# Use Tesseract instead of EasyOCR
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single --ocr tesseract
```

## 🔧 Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Mode | single | `single` or `continuous` |
| OCR Engine | easyocr | `easyocr` or `tesseract` |
| Auto-click | disabled | Enable with `--auto-click` |
| Confidence | 0.3 | Minimum confidence (0.0-1.0) |
| Scan Interval | 2.0s | Time between scans |

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Fail-safe**: Move mouse to top-left corner to abort
- **Confidence Threshold**: Won't click unless confidence > threshold  
- **Manual Mode**: Shows answers without clicking (default)
- **Emergency Stop**: Ctrl+C to stop anytime

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Open Kahoot** in your browser
2. **Position the window** so questions are clearly visible
3. **Activate virtual environment**: `source kahoot-env/bin/activate`
4. **Run the agent**: `python kahoot_agent.py --mode single`
5. **Review the answer** it suggests
6. **Manually click** the answer (safer than auto-click)

## 📁 Debug Mode

If something isn't working:
```bash
python example_usage.py
# Select option 4: Debug Mode
```

This will save debug images:
- `debug_question.png` - What it captured as the question
- `debug_answers.png` - What it captured as answer options

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Educational Use Only** - This is for learning about automation
2. **Check Terms of Service** - May violate Kahoot's ToS
3. **School Policies** - Could be considered cheating
4. **Test First** - Always test without auto-click first
5. **Use Responsibly** - Don't ruin the fun for others

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No question found" | Make sure Kahoot is clearly visible |
| OCR not working | Try `--ocr tesseract` or check lighting |
| Can't find answers | Check internet connection |
| Import errors | Rerun `python test_components.py` |

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. Try with different Kahoot questions
2. Experiment with confidence thresholds
3. Test both OCR engines to see which works better
4. Customize settings in `kahoot_agent.py` for your needs
