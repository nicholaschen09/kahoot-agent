# Testing Your Kahoot Agent on Real Games

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your virtual environment is active:
```bash
source kahoot-env/bin/activate
```

2. Verify everything works:
```bash
python test_components.py
```

## Method 1: Join a Live Kahoot Game

### Step 1: Find a Live Game
- Visit https://kahoot.it/
- Ask a teacher/friend to start a Kahoot game and share the game PIN
- OR look for public Kahoot games online

### Step 2: Position Your Screen
1. Open Kahoot in your browser
2. Enter the game PIN and join
3. Make sure the Kahoot window is clearly visible
4. Maximize the browser window for best OCR results
5. Wait for a question to appear

### Step 3: Test in Safe Mode (Recommended First)
```bash
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single
```

This will:
- Capture the question
- Extract text using OCR
- Search for the answer
- Display the recommended answer (but won't click)

### Step 4: Review Results
The agent will show you:
- The extracted question text
- The answer options it found
- The recommended answer with confidence score
- Debug images saved as `debug_question.png` and `debug_answers.png`

### Step 5: Manual Verification
- Check if the extracted question text is correct
- Verify the answer options were detected properly
- Manually click the recommended answer to test accuracy

## Method 2: Create Your Own Practice Game

### Step 1: Create a Kahoot Account
1. Go to https://kahoot.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Click "Create" to make a new kahoot

### Step 2: Create a Test Quiz
Make a simple quiz with questions like:
- "What is 2 + 2?" (Options: 3, 4, 5, 6)
- "What color do you get mixing red and blue?" (Options: Green, Purple, Yellow, Orange)
- "What is the capital of France?" (Options: London, Paris, Berlin, Madrid)

### Step 3: Host the Game
1. Click "Play" on your created kahoot
2. Choose "Teach" mode
3. Set it to "Player vs Player" 
4. Start the game
5. Join from another browser tab using the game PIN

### Step 4: Test the Agent
```bash
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single
```

## Method 3: Use Kahoot's Demo Mode

### Step 1: Find Demo Kahoots
- Visit the Kahoot website
- Look for "Demo" or "Sample" games
- Some are publicly available for testing

### Step 2: Practice Mode
- Many kahoots can be played in "practice mode"
- This gives you unlimited time to test

## Testing Commands

### Basic Testing (Safe - No Clicking)
```bash
# Test one question
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single

# Monitor continuously 
python kahoot_agent.py --mode continuous
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run debug mode to see what it captures
python test_components.py
```

### Advanced Testing (Use with Caution!)
```bash
# Auto-click with high confidence requirement
python kahoot_agent.py --mode continuous --auto-click --confidence 0.8

# Use Tesseract OCR instead of EasyOCR
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single --ocr tesseract
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### OCR Not Reading Text Correctly
- Make sure Kahoot window is maximized
- Ensure good lighting on your screen
- Try both OCR engines: `--ocr easyocr` or `--ocr tesseract`
- Check the debug images to see what was captured

### Search Not Finding Answers
- Verify internet connection
- Try simpler questions first
- Some very specific or new questions might not have online answers

### Button Detection Issues
- Make sure the full answers area is visible
- Try resizing the browser window
- Check that all 4 answer options are on screen

## Best Practices for Testing

1. **Start Simple**: Test with basic math or geography questions
2. **Use Safe Mode First**: Always test without auto-clicking initially
3. **Check Debug Images**: Review the captured images to ensure quality
4. **Test Different Question Types**: Try multiple choice, true/false, etc.
5. **Verify Accuracy**: Manually check if suggested answers are correct

## Example Test Session

```bash
# 1. Activate environment
source kahoot-env/bin/activate

# 2. Join a Kahoot game in your browser
# 3. Wait for a question to appear

# 4. Run the agent
python kahoot_agent.py --mode single

# 5. Review the output:
# - Check extracted question text
# - Verify answer options
# - Note the recommended answer and confidence
# - Manually click the suggested answer

# 6. For continuous testing
python kahoot_agent.py --mode continuous
```

## Safety Reminders

- **Educational Use Only**: This is for learning about automation
- **Get Permission**: Make sure you have permission to use automation tools
- **Test Environment**: Use practice games or your own kahoots when possible
- **Manual Verification**: Always verify answers before clicking
- **Respect Others**: Don't use this to unfairly win in competitive settings

## Performance Tips

- Use a stable internet connection
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Ensure good screen visibility
- Test during off-peak hours for better search performance
